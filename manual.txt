SERVER STEPS:

1. Clone BookStore server from github

2. cd into bookstore and build project using maven (after this target folder will be created)
	cd bookstore
	mvn clean package

3. Initialize database using init scripts
	source src/main/resources/init_database.sh

4. Run server with configuration file (look into conf file in order to change database url or port if it not default)
	java -jar target/bookstore-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server src/main/resources/bookstore-configuration.yml


Now the server and database are up and running.


CLIENT STEPS:
Next step is to run the client that will upload books to database and read few of them and print them in console.

1. Clone BookStore client from github
	git clone https://github.com/alenbakovic/bookstoreclient.git

2. cd into bookstoreclient and build project using maven (after this target folder will be created)
	cd bookstoreclient
	mvn clean package

3. Run client with following command
	java -jar target/bookstore-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

***IMPORTANT***
Each time you want to run again you will have to clean database first, using script from server repository
source src/main/resources/clean_database.sh
